**Today's Progress and Thoughts**:

In lack of project ideas I jumped the javascript30 challange, and completed the first project. A drum kit

## 15. Project form validator completed

### Day 15: June 24, 2020

**Today's Progress and Thoughts**:

Javascript file added, really didn't learn anything today. I need more of optimal projects/challanges, since I feel like I am standing still at the moment. lets see what tomorrow have to offer.

## 14. Project form validator
   

### Day 14: June 23, 2020

**Today's Progress and Thoughts**:

Started a new simple (I think) project. A form validator.
To this project I'm going to take with me lessons from before, presetting classes in the css (scss) file that is going to be later used, rather than doing it all in javascript, so I can just toggle between classes.

## 13. Project Expense manager completed

   <img src="img/expense-manager/expense-manager.JPG" height="500px">

### Day 13: June 22, 2020

**Today's Progress and Thoughts**:

Functionality of removing items from history added, and therefore project completed. 

The most valuable thing for me in this project was getting experience going through the javascript fundementals. Although the code is a mess, my lesson to next project is to not be afraid of rewrite the code to a better strategy, since in the long run it will be easier to follow trough.

## 12. Project Expense manager continues

### Day 12: June 21, 2020

**Today's Progress and Thoughts**:

Added expense- and income objects and id to to each action(income/expense), and change the balane formula to calculate from the objects and not the textcontent. This should make it easier to remove items from the list without the math of the balance fail.

## 11. Project Expense manager continues

### Day 11: June 20, 2020

**Today's Progress and Thoughts**:

I've come to a point where the whole code is a mess. Much that is without comments, and alot of code is doubles. Altogh I will not clean up this code, I shall walk away with the lesson to be more careful to begin with.

Also I am a little stuck at the moment, coing to think about it tonight and try to solve it tomorrow

## 10. Project Expense manager

### Day 10: June 19, 2020

**Today's Progress and Thoughts**:

Started a new project today, expense manager. I only made the basic index and styling setup. I feel like I am pretty (relative) good at css grid and flexbox. 

Also today I've passed the 10% mark through the 100daysofcode challange. I really feel like this shouldn't be too hard to complete.

## 9. Project game hangman completed
 <img src="img/hangman/hangman.JPG" alt="Hangman" id="hangman-img" height="500px">

### Day 9: June 18, 2020

**Today's Progress and Thoughts**:

Learnt tons during this project! I sure did underestimate how hard it would be, and how much code it would take to finish this.

I did get stuck for a good while trying to change properties of several divs with same class, not realising there were a dedicated selector (document.querySelectorAll("...")) for this purpose, and that the divs of the given class using this selector is bunted in a node, or a array if you will, and that I have to loop through the array to change the propertie for all the divs of the given class.

## 8. Project game hangman started

### Day 8: June 17, 2020

**Today's Progress and Thoughts**:

Started a game project this time, hangman! I only made a simple setup for the index, styling and images... To generate all the words I could use html, but I think its more effective if I just javascript to generate them (given that I learn how to do that).

### Day 7: June 16, 2020

**Today's Progress and Thoughts**:

Just finished my first (small) javascript project. A tip calculator! Fairly easy code. Just a couple formulas needed. It is responsive but do have som alignments "problems" that I do not care about to fix, since one of my mission is to get so musch javascript experience as possible.

## 6. Project tip calculator, first project!

### Day 6: June 15, 2020

**Today's Progress and Thoughts**:

## 5. Objects and arrays continues

### Day 5: June 14, 2020

**Today's Progress and Thoughts**:

Learned about web interactions and DOMs. How to manipulate and create documents content, structure and formating. Im starting to feel I know some of the core foundation and am ready to work on small projects. Project based learning is far more effective for me to learn and keep up the motivation to learn.

## 4. Objects and arrays continues

### Day 4: June 13, 2020

**Today's Progress and Thoughts**:

Continue to learn more about array and objects, and about some of the Math object, rest parametres and how to read string properties. All very handy

## 3. Objects and arrays

### Day 3: June 12, 2020

**Today's Progress and Thoughts**:

Learning about array and objects. Which is a way to group several values into a single value, and making it possible to iterate over arrays using for-loops.

## 2. Functions

### Day 2: June 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**:

Learning about functions, that can create a function value or can be used to declare a binding and give it a function as a value.

**Thoughts:**

A key today is to understand scopes, as bindings in given scopes behve differently.

## 1. If and else statements and for and while loops.

### Day 1: June 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**:

Learning about fundumental statements

**Thoughts:**

So far so good. I am a little (barely) familiar with python, and it looks very familiar.
