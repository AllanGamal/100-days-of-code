**Today's Progress and Thoughts**:

## 5. Objects and arrays continues

### Day 5: June 14, 2020 

**Today's Progress and Thoughts**:
Learned about web interactions and DOMs. How to manipulate and create documents content, structure and formating. Im starting to feel I know some of the core foundation and am ready to work on small projects. Project based learning is far more effective for me to learn and keep up the motivation to learn.
   
## 4. Objects and arrays continues

### Day 4: June 13, 2020 

**Today's Progress and Thoughts**:
Continue to learn more about array and objects, and about some of the Math object, rest parametres and how to read string properties. All very handy

## 3. Objects and arrays

### Day 3: June 12, 2020 

**Today's Progress and Thoughts**:
Learning about array and objects. Which is a way to group several values into a single value, and making it possible to iterate over arrays using for-loops.

## 2. Functions

### Day 2: June 11, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:
Learning about functions, that can create a function value or can be used to declare a binding and give it a function as a value. 

**Thoughts:** 
A key today is to understand scopes, as bindings in given scopes behve differently.

## 1. If and else statements and for and while loops.

### Day 1: June 10, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:
Learning about fundumental statements

**Thoughts:** 
So far so good. I am a little (barely) familiar with python, and it looks very familiar.
