## 3. Objects and arrays

### Day 3: June 12, 2020 

**Today's Progress and Thoughts**:
Learning about array and objects. Which is a way to group several values into a single value, and making it possible to iterate over arrays using for-loops.

## 2. Functions

### Day 2: June 11, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:
Learning about functions, that can create a function value or can be used to declare a binding and give it a function as a value. 

**Thoughts:** 
A key today is to understand scopes, as bindings in given scopes behve differently.

### Day 1: June 10, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:
Learning about fundumental statements

**Thoughts:** 
So far so good. I am a little (barely) familiar with python, and it looks very familiar.
